# React-Redux-Projects
Hands-on React projects that leverage Redux for state management, Redux Toolkit for streamlined development, and Redux Thunk for handling asynchronous operations

# React Redux Essentials

Welcome to the React Redux Essentials repository, where you'll find a collection of simple yet practical projects demonstrating the core implementations of Redux Toolkit. This repository serves as a hands-on guide to implement state management in React applications, providing clear examples of interacting with APIs using HTTP methods such as GET and POST.

## Key Features

- **Redux Toolkit**: Utilize the official, opinionated, batteries-included toolset for efficient Redux development.
- **API Integration**: Learn to seamlessly integrate external APIs and handle asynchronous data fetching and state updates.
- **HTTP Methods**: Explore the use of various HTTP methods to interact with APIs and manage data flow.

## Getting Started

To get the most out of these projects, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. If a project contains a `db.json` file, it's designed to work with json-server to create a fake REST API. Run the following command to start the server and watch the `db.json` file:

   ```sh
   json-server --watch db.json
